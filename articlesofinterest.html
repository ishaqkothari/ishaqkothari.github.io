<div class="project">
  <h2>Project 1: Integration of Single-Cell Modalities Using VAEs</h2>
  <p>Designed and implemented deep learning pipelines to replace traditional dimensionality reduction tech-
    niques like PCA for large-scale dataset integration.
    – Improved cross-dataset compatibility by leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), enabling better
    alignment of overlapping and nonoverlapping features.
    – Validated the approach on benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved information retention and scal-
    ability for the analysis of complex high-dimensional data.</a>.</p>

  <h2>Five Bar Linkage Robot Design and Analysis</h2>
  <p>ADesigned and manufactured a quadriped robot using SolidWorks, optimizing linkage geometry for efficient
    gait patterns.
    – Evaluated preliminary design by estimating center of mass, load on motors, and power usage.
    – Simulated walking dynamics using forward and inverse kinematics as well as PyBullet.</p>
