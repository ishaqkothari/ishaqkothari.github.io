# Professional Experience

## New York Genome Center - Technology Innovation Lab  
**Research Associate**  
*June 2024 – Present*  
- Developed and optimized simulations for spatial transcription imaging technologies, improving pre-deployment validation processes.  
- Integrated deep learning algorithms to analyze high-dimensional DNA sequencing data using HPC systems.  
- Presented findings on advancements in spatial transcriptomics at an internal research symposium.

## Columbia University - Steingart Lab  
**Research Assistant**  
*January 2024 – May 2024*  
- Designed a precision jig for acoustic testing of lithium-ion batteries using SolidWorks and CNC machining.  
- Improved fixture alignment, increasing testing capacity by 50% and reducing setup time by 30%.  
- Documented the jig design process to ensure reproducibility for future research.

## Oberlin College - Scofield Lab  
**Research Assistant**  
*October 2022 – May 2023*  
- Fully automated data collection using a Unix-based sensor hub to calculate thermal efficiencies and power consumption, reducing time needed to collect sensor data by 75%.  
- Designed and prototyped WiFi-enabled propane meter using microcontrollers for heat pump efficiency measurement.  
- Propane meter facilitated in-depth data analysis, enabling the assessment of setback efficiencies and distinguishing between energy consumption from the propane furnace and electric heat pumps in a home energy system.

## Michigan Technological University  
**Research Assistant**  
*June 2022 – August 2023*  
- Researched declarative logic software development with Alloy and Spin for OECD Rules as Code- based project modeling Michigan’s statutory expungement law MCL 780.621. Work on the project included comprehensive research on the statute through interviews with attorneys, judges, and paralegals, as well as utilizing linear temporal logic to mathematically model the statute. 

## Oberlin College  
**Teaching Assistant (Calculus II)**  
*September 2022 – May 2023*

**Teaching Assistant (Linear Algebra)**  
*September 2021 – June 2022*
