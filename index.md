<h3 class="small_title">Introduction</h3>

<p class="paragraph">
I’m a Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science student at Columbia University, graduating in 2025. I’m particularly interested in careers that blend software development, mathematics, and core engineering skills, with a focus on computational biology and robotics. Outside of school, I enjoy building computers and mechanical keyboards, staying active, and traveling. Feel free to explore some of my projects and a summary of my professional experience on this website!</p>
